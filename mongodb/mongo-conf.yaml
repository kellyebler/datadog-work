    # Check the connection string you normally use to connect to the database
    # and try to map those flags to options in the mongo conf.yaml example file.
    # for example, if you use a connection string like this:
    # mongodb://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DB_NAME>
    # then you should set the db_name to <DB_NAME>
